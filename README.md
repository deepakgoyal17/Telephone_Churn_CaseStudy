Welcome to the case study module on Telecom Churn Prediction!

 

In the telecommunication industry, customers tend to change operators if not provided with attractive schemes and offers.
It is very important for any telecom operator to prevent the present customers from churning to other operators. 
As a data scientist, your task in this case study would be to build an ML model which can predict if the customer will churn or not in a particular month based on the past data.

In this modeling excercise, we applied EDA to find insights and then PCA was applied to filter on columns and then we build out the models using Logistic regression and Random Forest
